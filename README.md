# Udacity_projects_streaming
In this project, you will construct a streaming event pipeline around Apache Kafka and its ecosystem. Using public data from the [Chicago Transit Authority](https://www.transitchicago.com/data/) we will construct an event pipeline around Kafka that allows us to simulate and display the status of train lines in real time.

###Project Summary and  Architecture
The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) has asked us to develop a dashboard displaying system status for its commuters. We have decided to use Kafka and ecosystem tools like REST Proxy and Kafka Connect to accomplish this task.
